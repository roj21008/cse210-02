# Hilo
Hilo is a game in which the player guesses if the next card drawn by the dealer will be higher or 
lower than the previous one. Points are won or lost based on whether or not the player guessed correctly. 
The player earns 100 points if they guessed correctly. The player loses 75 points if they guessed incorrectly.
If a player reaches 0 points the game is over.
